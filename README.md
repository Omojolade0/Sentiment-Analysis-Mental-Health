# Sentiment-Analysis-Mental-Health
Sentiment analysis system to categorize mental health states using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
The analysis is performed using both a Logistic Regression model and a Neural Network (LSTM) model to evaluate their performance in classifying statements related to mental health.
# Categories
The model categorizes mental health statements into the following categories:
Normal: Indicates that the statement does not suggest any mental health issues. The individual is considered to be in a regular state of well-being.
Depression: This category is assigned to statements that suggest signs of depression, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, or changes in sleep and appetite.
Suicidal: Assigned to statements that express thoughts or intentions of self-harm or suicide. This is a critical category requiring immediate attention and intervention.
Anxiety: For statements indicating anxiety, such as excessive worry, nervousness, or panic attacks.
Stress: This includes statements related to high levels of stress or feeling overwhelmed by lifeâ€™s demands.
Bi-Polar: This category includes statements that reflect mood swings characteristic of bipolar disorder, including periods of extreme highs and lows.
Personality Disorder: Assigned to statements that suggest traits of personality disorders, such as unstable relationships, self-image, or emotions.

**Implementation**
# Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and unnecessary columns. Text data is cleaned using regular expressions, tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorizer for text feature extraction.
Label Encoding: Transforms categorical labels into numeric form.

# Model Training and Evaluation
Logistic Regression:
Trained using TF-IDF vectorized features.
Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.
Neural Network (LSTM):
Tokenizes and pads sequences for input into an LSTM network.
Trained with an embedding layer followed by LSTM layers and dropout for regularization.
Evaluated based on accuracy metrics.
# Implemented Algorithms
Logistic Regression: A traditional classification algorithm to set a baseline for comparison.
Neural Network (LSTM): A deep learning model designed to handle sequential data and capture more complex patterns in text.
# Results
Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 75.5%
Confusion Matrix and Classification Report: Provides insights into model performance across different mental health categories.
Neural Network (LSTM)
Test Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 76.5% on the test set.
# Comparison
The Neural Network generally provides better performance than Logistic Regression due to its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

# Future Work
Algorithm Improvement, Hyperparameter Tuning, Advanced Feature Engineering and Scalability.
